In the short amount of time i've studied Python,
I have learned a substantial amount about the program.
So far I have covered data types, functions, methods and classes.
Python is very intuitive and easy to understand.
Its amazing how all of these subjects all converge to write a program.
I'm looking forward to learning more Python!
